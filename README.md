Welcome to Social Connect! This is a social media aggregator designed for content creators to be able to manage all their social media accounts from one website.

To run our backend you will need maven installed and to add an application.properties file with your database of choice in there. Then run:
cd server
mvn spring-boot:run

To run our frontend, run cd client, and then run npm i to install all frontend dependencies. Finally, run npm start.
